# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is used when some decision is to be taken to perform further tasks. Conditional statements are defined by using if statement, else if statement, and else statement.

Researched answer: Conditional statement, also called decision tree, is a well defined instruction that produces an unique output based on the value of the input with if/else statements and is the fundamental to computer programming.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a tool used and allows for collaborative and code sharing to build coding projects or personal portfolios. Github is a cloud based service that stores these collaborative projects and resources.

Researched answer: Git is an open-sourced control system and powerful tool used for sharing and working on code. Many people are able to contribute to the same code base. Github is a cloud based serivce that helps developers store and manage their code.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: ||, &&, !

Researched answer: || or, && and, ! not

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is where the element is placed in a string or array. The difference between an index and value is that value is an input of pieces of information whereas index is the placement of those input pieces of information.

Researched answer: An index is a placement of each character in a string. For example, in a string, it is always starts at zero going forward (0,1,2,3...). Index and values are not quite the same. A value determines a role and can be numbers, strings and functions where as index is a placement of elements.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: A string represents set variables that are used for prompts/statements and are always wrapped with " " or ` `. Both arrays and strings are able to store objects. However, an array is a tool that is used to hold lots data in a single variable. Arrays stores a set of elements of the same data type while string can only store characters. 

Researched answer: Arrays are variables that stores organized data to access particular information and has access to built in functions that can be used to manipulate the content. Strings are a collection of characters wrapped in double or single quotes. With some similarities of storing objects, strings are not arrays. Arrays can hold more than one value at a time while a string can only hold character data.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In order to do proper pair programming, there is 1 person as a driver and 1 person as a navigator. The person navigating has the responsibility of confirming if the driver has proper syntax, proper spelling, researching and most importantly interperating the proper code to the driver. The driver is responsible for typing out the code that the navigator is interprating and testing out the code.  

Researched answer: Pair programming helps partners distribute cognitive load and skills when driving and navigating. The driver is responsible for entering information and follow instructions from the navigator. The navigator is repsonsible for reading the instructions and relaying the code to the driver.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are built in functions that take in other functions as arguments or returns a function. It is useful for iterations when an argument executes once for every item in the array. 
                
2. Jest: Jest is a testing framwrok in javascript. In the framework, tgere are collections of files that contain code functionality. By adding .test.js, it alerts Jest on which files to execute and all file and directories are mananged by yarn. Yarn Although unit test testing is extensive and time consuming, it can be reduced to a great extent with jest.

3. Objects: Each value is categorized as a primitive value or an object. Primitive values are compared by value and is categorized with "typeof". Objects are compared by reference  and is categorized by "instanceof". Some primitive types can be wrapped in objects. Objects are variables and can contain many values, is written as name:value pairs.

4. Method: Method is a function that belongs to an object and what the object does. It allows methods to be included and creates a variable assessing the value in the object. It is separated by ":". 

5. Classes: Classes, also known as "special functions" is a tool to organize code and bundle things together neatly. Classes can serve as a template in terms of what the code is and what it does. It is defined by using "class" and the names are always capitalized.
